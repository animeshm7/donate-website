				<br>What Can You Do For Widlife Welfare
		</div>
		<div class="p2">
			<br>Each species plays a valuable and distinct role in the ecosystem in which it lives. We are directly dependent on the contributions of some species. One-third of our food is pollinated by bird, bat, and insect species—many of which are endangered. We must conserve these species and protect their habitats. Forests and other wild places must be preserved as homes for wild animals.<br>

			<br>Stand Up For Wildlife<br>
		</div><img src="images/squirrel in hands.jpg" alt="map">
		<div class="p2">
			<br><br>Your voice matters! Urge elected officials and government agencies to support policies—such as ivory bans and other restrictions on wildlife trade—that protect animals.<br>
			Sign up for AWI eAlerts, which keep you informed about urgent animal protection issues and provide quick and easy ways to get in touch with policymakers.<br>
			Check out AWI’s publications about various wildlife protection issues, and share the publications with others.<br>

			<br><br>Learn About Endangered Species and their Habitats<br>
		</div><img src="images/images (1).jpg" alt="map">
		<div class="p2">
			<br><br>Teach your friends and family about endangered species and other animals that live near you.
			<br>For information on species at risk, visit the CITES database at www.cites.org, the US Fish and Wildlife Service Endangered Species website, or the more inclusive and cautionary IUCN Red List at www.iucnredlist.org.
			<br>Visit a national wildlife refuge, park, or other open space and learn about the endangered species and other animals who live there. Stay informed and support policies that keep these areas wild and protect native species. 
			<br>Teachers: Help spread awareness in your own classroom about endangered species with our educational poster.

			<br>If you see an animals at the park, on a nature trail, or near a water source, let them be and do not remove them from their environment. These animals survive best in their own habitat. Take a picture instead.
			<br><br>The Endangered Species Act has proven to be an effective safety net for imperiled species—extinction has been prevented for more than 98 percent of the animals under its care. Urge your elected officials to preserve the important safeguards in the Act.

			<br><br>Protect the Environment<br>
		</div><img src="images/istock-636475496.jpg" alt="map">
		<div class="p2">
			<br><br>One of the easiest and most effective ways to help wildlife is to preserve the environment in which the animals live.
			<br>Participate in or hold your own local trash clean-up to help protect the habitats of endangered species and other wildlife.
			<br>Reduce, reuse, recycle!
			<br>Save energy. Driving less, using energy efficient vehicles and appliances, and simply turning off the lights when you leave a room reduce energy use. Many power plants rely on coal and other fossil fuels that damage animal habitats when they are extracted and pollute the environment and contribute to climate change when they are burned.
			<br>Plant native flowers, trees, and bushes in your backyard. This gives local wild animals food, shelter, and a place to raise families. Avoid chemical pesticides and fertilizers.

			<br><br>Help Protect The Birds<br>
		</div><img src="images/thumb_400.jpg" alt="map">
		<div class="p2">
			<br><br>Approximately 300 million to 1 billion birds die each year due to collisions. Take steps to prevent bird strikes by making windows more bird-friendly by applying visible markings on the outside.
			<br>The fall migration is a great time to see many birds that normally aren’t found in our region because, depending on a species' individual route, birds may pause between breeding and wintering ranges. This allows us to see them as they fly through.
			<br>Often, however, these birds are killed before they make it to their winter homes.  The American Bird Conservancy reports that hundreds of millions of birds die in collisions with communication towers, power lines and vehicles.
